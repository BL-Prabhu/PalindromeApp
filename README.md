# Palindrome Checker App
## UC9: Recursive Palindrome Checker

---

## 📌 Objective
The objective of the PalindromeChecker App is to design and implement a console-based Java application that validates whether a given string is a palindrome using recursion.

This use case strengthens understanding of recursion and core data structure concepts.

---

## 🎯 Goal
Check whether a string is a palindrome using recursion.

---

## 🔁 Flow
1. Accept input string from user.
2. Compare first and last characters.
3. If equal → recursively check remaining substring.
4. Base condition stops recursion when:
  - All characters match, or
  - A mismatch is found.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

### 1️⃣ Recursion
A technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller subproblems.

### 2️⃣ Base Condition
Prevents infinite recursion and terminates recursive calls.

### 3️⃣ Call Stack
Memory structure used to manage method calls during recursion.

---

## 🗂 Data Structure Used
**Call Stack**

Each recursive call is stored in the call stack until the base condition is reached.
