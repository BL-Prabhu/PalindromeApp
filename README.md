# 🚀 Palindrome Checker App

The **Palindrome Checker App** is a console-based Java application designed to validate whether a given string is a palindrome using multiple approaches.  
This project strengthens **core Java fundamentals**, **string handling**, and **data structure concepts** through progressive use cases.

## 🔹 UC4: Character Array Based Palindrome Check

### 🎯 Objective
To determine whether a given string is a palindrome by converting it into a **character array** and comparing characters efficiently using the **two-pointer technique**.

---

### 🔄 Application Flow

1. Program starts
2. Input string is converted into a `char[]`
3. Two pointers are initialized (start & end)
4. Characters at both ends are compared
5. Pointers move inward after each comparison
6. Result is displayed on the console
7. Program exits

### 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- **Character Array (`char[]`)**  
  A primitive array used to store individual characters of a string.

- **Array Indexing**  
  Accessing elements using index positions starting from `0`.

- **Two-Pointer Technique**  
  One pointer starts from the beginning and the other from the end, reducing unnecessary comparisons.

- **Conditional Statements**  
  Used to detect mismatched characters.

- **Time Complexity Awareness**  
  Optimized solution with **O(n)** time complexity and **O(1)** extra space.

- **Console Output**  
  `System.out.println()` is used to display the result.

### 🧩 Data Structure Used
- `char[]`
